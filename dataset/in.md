# `Integral Calculus basics`
Integral calculus is a process to calculate the **`AREA`** between a function and the X-axis.

## Core idea of Integral Calculus

## `Riemann Sums`
A Riemann sum is an **approximation** of the area under a curve by dividing it into multiple simple shapes (like rectangles or trapezoids).

### `Riemann Sums Notation`

[Refer to Khan academy: Definite integral as the limit of a Riemann sum](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-accumulation-riemann-sums/modal/v/riemann-sums-and-integrals)

The letter `ʃ` (reads as "esh" or just "integral") is called `the Integral symbol/sign`.


### Left & Right Riemann Sums Approximation
[Refer to Maths is fun: Integral Approximations](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integral-approximations.html)

- `Left Riemann Sum`: take the Left boundary value of `Δx` to be the rectangle's **height**.
- `Right Riemann Sum`: take the Right boundary value of `Δx` to be the rectangle's **height**.

As you can see, they would be either Over-estimated or Under-estimated. Neither of these approximations would be called a good one, normally.

### Midpoint Sums Approximation
It's an enhancement to the Left sums and Right sums, it takes the midpoint value, and sometimes makes better approximation.
