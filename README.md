# Jupyter Notebooks
Store all my jupyter notebooks and related things.

## About Python Enviroment
This folder should be good to run in virtual enviroment, specifically the `pipenv` enviroment.
There's a `Pipfile` under folder, detailed the `Python3` enviroment dependencies.
Yet there still are a few files needing `python2` enviroment, hence I created a `venv2` sub-folder,
includes the `python2` enviroment. 

Note that, this jupyter notebook environment is already installed with customized theme, plugins. 
So it only will work well when you properly reinstall with the `Pipfile`.
